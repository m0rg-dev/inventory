# wolfe inventory

Hacky little Vue.js / Rust-based inventory system for personal use.

This project isn't finished yet. I made it to solve a problem I had
with equipment I owned; if you have different problems it might not be
useful, and if you have different equipment it might not be usable.

If you'd like to check it out anyways, go ahead and `docker-compose
build && docker-compose up` to start a containerized development
server. Give it a couple seconds to get going and browse to
`localhost:3000` for the web interface. Both the frontend and backend
components will hot-reload in case you want to try changes out.
